# The Pincer Movement: An Interactive Data Visualization

This repository contains the source code for a single-page application (SPA) infographic designed to accompany the long-form investigative report, "The Pincer Movement," published on _Reclaiming Democracy's Promise_.

## About This Project

This project aims to translate complex, systemic research into a clear, digestible, and interactive visual narrative. It dissects the coordinated alliance between the bureaucratic overhaul plans of Project 2025 and the ideological mobilization of Christian Nationalist networks, exposing the profound threat they pose to American democracy.

The infographic visualizes key findings related to:

- **Financial Networks:** Tracing the flow of "dark money" through major trusts and donor-advised funds, including the $1.6 billion donation that fuels the movement.
- **Personnel Interlocks:** Mapping the key figures—"The Architect," "The Bureaucratic Enforcer," and "The Grassroots General"—who operate across policy, funding, and activist organizations.
- **Ideological Pipelines:** Demonstrating the direct connection between theological mandates (like the Seven Mountains Mandate) and specific legislative policy.
- **Electoral Tactics:** Illustrating the multi-pronged strategy ("Steeplechase," "Watchtower," "Checkmate") used to shape the electorate and influence election outcomes.
- **Technological Enablers:** Highlighting the role of surveillance and data analysis tools in creating a "chilling effect" on civic life.

## Technical Details

This visualization was built from the ground up as a self-contained web application with a focus on responsiveness, performance, and data clarity.

- **Framework:** Single-Page Application (SPA)
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first, responsive design). The UI/UX is designed with a dark theme and red accents to complement the aesthetic of the source publication.
- **Visualizations:** **Chart.js** (for all interactive charts, rendered on HTML Canvas). All diagrams, such as flowcharts and timelines, are built with structured HTML and CSS to avoid dependencies and ensure performance.
- **Core Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)

**Key Features:**

- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile viewing.
- Interactive charts with tooltips to explore data points.
- A clean, narrative-driven layout that guides the user through the complex investigation.
- Adherence to strict security and performance standards by avoiding external libraries where possible and using optimized, inline code.
